### Python demo code for ["Guided Image Filtering" (ECCV 2010)](http://kaiminghe.com/publications/pami12guidedfilter.pdf)

Port to Python by Ruby Childs, based on the Matlab code of Kaiming He (kahe@microsoft.com)

This code is for academic purpose only. Not for commercial/industrial activities.

#### Usage:

* `guidedfilter.py` - guided filter implementation (Eqn(5), (6), (8) in the paper)
* `guidedfilter_color.py` - guided filter for color guidance (Eqn(14), (15), (16) in the paper)

The four examples can be run using the `example_script.py` to see the results shown in the paper.
